An XSD schema is a mechanism to check the validity of an XML document, ie define its structure: what elements, what types of data, what attributes, in what order, how many times are repeated, and so on.

This project allows us to validate XML Structure against XSD Schema, through the user provided strings. And know if the document is correct.
